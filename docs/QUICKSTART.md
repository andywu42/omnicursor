# OmniCursor Quickstart

This repository now has two layers:

1. The preserved Cursor starter kit in [`.cursor/rules`](../.cursor/rules), [`docs`](../docs), and [`tests`](../tests)
2. The OmniCursor MCP backend in [`src/omnicursor`](../src/omnicursor) and [`skills`](../skills)

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or newer
- A virtual environment for this repo

The official MCP Python SDK currently requires Python 3.10+.

## Install

```bash
python3.10 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Run the MCP server

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
omnicursor-server
```

The default transport is `stdio`, which is the right starting point for a local Cursor MCP server.

## Use in Cursor

1. Open the repository root, not a parent folder.
2. Confirm the preserved rules under [`.cursor/rules`](../.cursor/rules) are visible in Cursor.
3. Register a local MCP server command that runs `omnicursor-server` from this repo's virtual environment.
4. Use the preserved rules for brainstorming, planning, ticketing, and adapter behavior.
5. The MCP tools enhance each rule with routing, skill loading, and compliance checking.

## Available MCP Tools

### `get_agent_context(category: str)`

Returns routing context (agent name, instructions, recommended skill) for a given category.

| Category | Agent | Matching Rule | Recommended Skill |
|----------|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| `debugging` | systematic-debugger | 10-systematic-debugging.mdc | systematic-debugging |
| `brainstorming` | brainstorming-guide | 10-brainstorming.mdc | brainstorming |
| `planning` | plan-writer | 11-writing-plans.mdc | writing-plans |
| `ticketing` | ticket-planner | 12-plan-ticket.mdc | plan-ticket |
| `adapter` | adapter-guide | 20-adapter-stub.mdc | adapter-stub |

Unrecognized categories fall back to `omnicursor-generalist`.

### `invoke_skill(skill_name: str)`

Loads a Markdown skill from the `skills/` directory and returns its content.

### `check_compliance(skill_name: str, response_summary: str)`

Checks whether a model response complies with a skill's expected output pattern. Returns a checklist with pass/fail for each expected element.

## Available Skills

| Skill | File | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `systematic-debugging` | `skills/systematic-debugging.md` | Structured debugging: reproduce, hypothesize, verify |
| `brainstorming` | `skills/brainstorming.md` | Refine ideas into validated design docs |
| `writing-plans` | `skills/writing-plans.md` | Design docs into TDD implementation plans |
| `plan-ticket` | `skills/plan-ticket.md` | Plans into YAML ticket contract templates |
| `adapter-stub` | `skills/adapter-stub.md` | Bucket 3 dry-run stubs with fail-soft behavior |

## End-to-End Flow in Cursor

A typical session using all three MCP tools:

1. **User invokes `@10-brainstorming` with an idea.**
   - Rule calls `get_agent_context("brainstorming")` for routing context.
   - Rule calls `invoke_skill("brainstorming")` for the full methodology.
   - Collaborative dialogue refines the idea into a design doc.
   - Rule calls `check_compliance("brainstorming", summary)` to verify output quality.
   - Design saved to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`.

2. **User invokes `@11-writing-plans` with the design doc path.**
   - Rule calls `get_agent_context("planning")` for routing context.
   - Design is broken into bite-sized TDD tasks with adversarial review.
   - Rule calls `check_compliance("writing-plans", summary)` to verify.
   - Plan saved to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>.md`.

3. **User invokes `@12-plan-ticket` with the plan path.**
   - Rule calls `get_agent_context("ticketing")` for routing context.
   - Deterministic repo detection runs. YAML ticket template generated.
   - Rule calls `check_compliance("plan-ticket", summary)` to verify.

4. **(Stage 2) User invokes `@20-adapter-stub` for external integration.**
   - Rule calls `get_agent_context("adapter")` for routing context.
   - Dry-run payload constructed. Fail-soft behavior enforced.

## Notes

- [`HOW_TO_RUN_IN_CURSOR.md`](../HOW_TO_RUN_IN_CURSOR.md) is preserved as the original starter-kit walkthrough.
- [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) remains the bucket and adapter contract reference.
