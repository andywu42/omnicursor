# OmniCursor Session Handoff

**Date**: 2026-04-09
**Focus**: full codebase review, role alignment, architecture refresh, and updated capstone planning

## What Was Reviewed

- Core runtime:
  - `.cursor/hooks.json`
  - `.cursor/hooks/_common.py`
  - `.cursor/hooks/on_prompt.py`
  - `.cursor/hooks/on_shell.py`
  - `.cursor/hooks/on_stop.py`
  - `.cursor/hooks/pattern_loader.py`
  - `src/omnicursor/server.py`
  - `src/omnicursor/agents.py`
  - `src/omnicursor/compliance.py`
  - `src/omnicursor/skills.py`
  - `src/omnicursor/db.py`
  - `src/omnicursor/patterns.py`
- Planning / architecture inputs:
  - `OmniCursor_Architecture_FINALupdated33.docx`
  - `OmniCursor_DoD_Rubric.md`
  - `investigacion_omninode_ClaudeCode.md`
  - `HANDOFF.md`
  - `CLAUDE.md`
- Reference:
  - `omniclaude/`

## Key Findings

1. Phase 3A is genuinely complete at the architecture level.
2. The repo has a real three-layer system:
   - Rules
   - Hooks
   - MCP
3. The next bottlenecks are not "discovering the architecture" anymore. They are:
   - runtime proof in real Cursor
   - CI/CD automation
   - pattern write-path completion
   - clear OmniCursor -> OmniIntelligence integration planning
4. There is currently **no `.github/workflows/` directory** in the repo.
5. Local lint is clean, but local tests are not fully green:
   - `.venv/bin/ruff check src/ tests/ .cursor/hooks/` -> passes
   - `.venv/bin/pytest tests/ -q` -> `121 passed, 1 failed`
6. The current failing test is:
   - `tests/test_skills.py::test_available_skills_lists_all`
   - cause: `skills/README.md` is being included by `SkillRepository.available_skills()`
7. `docs/handoffs/` did not exist before this session. It now exists through this handoff.

## Opinion / Direction

The team split is good, but only if the boundaries stay explicit:

- **Sam** owns correctness automation:
  - GitHub Actions
  - green baseline
  - test/lint/docs verification on push
- **Andy** owns the OmniCursor backend and Cursor connection story:
  - MCP server
  - agent registry
  - routing
  - research on how Cursor-side agents or future plugin surfaces can connect
- **Kailash** owns OmniClaude reuse *inside OmniCursor*:
  - hooks integration
  - routing/runtime borrowing
  - pattern lifecycle path from OmniClaude concepts
- **Julian** owns external ecosystem integration:
  - OmniIntelligence
  - OmniMemory
  - OmniDash
  - Dockerized local integration path

This split reduces the biggest overlap risk:
- Kailash should own what gets reused in OmniCursor from OmniClaude.
- Julian should own how OmniCursor connects outward to the rest of OmniNode.

## Files Created This Session

- `OmniCursor_Architecture_FINAL44.docx`
- `docs/handoffs/2026-04-09-architecture-role-alignment.md`

## What Changed in the New Architecture Document

The new document keeps the existing structure/style but updates the content to reflect:

- current codebase reality
- completion of Phase 3A
- the new team role split
- role-specific next deliverables
- DoD-aligned completion criteria
- realistic risks and mitigations
- honest current verification status (`121 / 122` tests, lint clean)

## Recommended Next Actions

### Sam

- Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Make lint + tests run on push / PR
- Fix the `skills/README.md` regression in skill discovery
- Add docs validation if lightweight

### Andy

- Harden `src/omnicursor/server.py` and `src/omnicursor/agents.py`
- Clarify whether "Cursor plugin" is a real near-term path or just a research track
- Document how OmniCursor should connect to Cursor agents/configs without assuming unsupported APIs

### Kailash

- Continue extracting only the reusable hook/runtime patterns from `omniclaude/`
- Design or implement `store_pattern`
- Keep the JSON persistence path lightweight for MVP

### Julian

- Use `investigacion_omninode_ClaudeCode.md` to define the first realistic OmniCursor -> OmniIntelligence bridge
- Identify what should connect now vs later across OmniIntelligence, OmniMemory, OmniDash
- Build a minimal Dockerized local intelligence path for integration experiments

## Current Risk Register

- `beforeSubmitPrompt` may emit `systemMessage` without Cursor consuming it
- no CI pipeline yet
- one local regression already exists in test coverage
- plugin scope could create unnecessary scope creep
- OmniIntelligence integration could become too heavy if it is treated like full-platform parity

## Practical Summary

OmniCursor is no longer blocked on architectural confusion.

It is now in the execution phase where the team should:

1. restore a fully green automated baseline
2. complete the pattern write path
3. validate runtime behavior in real Cursor
4. define a believable integration runway into OmniIntelligence without turning the capstone into a full OmniNode rebuild
