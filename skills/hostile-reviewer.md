# hostile-reviewer

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the hostile-reviewer skill."

## Architecture

```
SKILL.md   -> thin shell (this file)
node       -> omniintelligence/src/omniintelligence/review_pairing/ (multi-model review)
entry      -> omniintelligence.review_pairing.cli_review (CLI)
```

Node invocation (working directory must be the `omniintelligence` repo root):

```bash
uv run python -m omniintelligence.review_pairing.cli_review \  # local-path-ok: omniintelligence direct CLI invocation until OMN-8770 onex run migration
  --pr <N> --repo <owner/repo> --model codex --model deepseek-r1 2>/dev/null
```

## Dispatch Surface

**Target**: Agent Teams + Local LLM

## Description

Multi-model adversarial review with **iterative convergence**. The skill loops automatically,
applying fixes after each pass, until **2 consecutive passes produce nothing above NIT severity**.
A single pass catches ~60% of issues; fixes from pass N introduce new issues caught in pass N+1.
Iterating to convergence eliminates this false-completeness problem.

Calls Codex CLI (primary, ChatGPT-class model) and local LLMs (DeepSeek-R1) for independent
cross-check. Returns all findings with per-model attribution. Output is MANDATORY -- the skill
always produces a result artifact even when verdict is `clean` (empty `findings` array is valid
for `clean`). Cannot rubber-stamp without running the models.

Codex CLI is the primary reviewer because it produces high signal-to-noise findings
(typically 5-15 precise structural observations vs 40-55 pattern-level noise from local
models alone). DeepSeek-R1 provides a local reasoning cross-check. Additional local
models (qwen3-coder, qwen3-14b) are available via `--models` override when broader
coverage is needed.

This skill consolidates the former `hostile-reviewer` (PR-only, Claude-only, exactly-2-risks),
`external-model-review` (file-only, multi-model), and `code-review-sweep` (static analysis)
into a single unified skill.

## Modes

### PR Mode (`--pr <N> --repo <owner/repo>`)

Reviews a PR diff using multi-model adversarial review.

```bash
/hostile-reviewer --pr 433 --repo OmniNode-ai/omniintelligence
```

### File Mode (`--file <path>` or `--plan-path <path>`)

Reviews a plan or design document using multi-model adversarial review.
This replaces the former `/external-model-review` skill.

`--plan-path` is an alias for `--file` — both are accepted and behave identically.

```bash
/hostile-reviewer --file docs/plans/my-plan.md
/hostile-reviewer --plan-path docs/plans/my-plan.md
```

### Gate Mode (`--pr <N> --repo <owner/repo> --gate`)

Merge gate mode. Dispatches 3 parallel review agents (scope, correctness, conventions),
collects structured verdicts, aggregates findings by severity, and produces a structured
`pass`/`fail` gate verdict plus `extra_status` of `passed`/`blocked` for pipeline consumption. This mode absorbs the
former `review_gate` skill.

```bash
/hostile-reviewer --pr 433 --repo OmniNode-ai/omniclaude --gate
/hostile-reviewer --pr 433 --repo OmniNode-ai/omniclaude --gate --strict
```

**Gate verdict output** (`extra_status`):
- `passed`: no blocking findings across all agents
- `blocked`: one or more blocking findings (MAJOR+ in default mode, MINOR+ in `--strict`)

**Requires** `--pr` and `--repo`. Mutually exclusive with `--file`.

**Skill result** (written to `$ONEX_STATE_DIR/skill-results/{context_id}/hostile-reviewer.json`):

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| `skill_name` | `"hostile-reviewer"` |
| `status` | `"success"` (gate passed) / `"partial"` (gate blocked) |
| `extra_status` | `"passed"` / `"blocked"` |
| `extra` | `{"gate_verdict": str, "total_findings": int, "blocking_count": int, "agent_count": 3, "verdicts": [...]}` |

### Static Mode (`--static`)

Runs static analysis checks across repos without adversarial multi-model review.
This replaces the former `/code-review-sweep` skill.

```bash
/hostile-reviewer --static                                        # Full scan all repos (first run = dry-run)
/hostile-reviewer --static --dry-run                              # Report only
/hostile-reviewer --static --ticket                               # Create Linear tickets for findings
/hostile-reviewer --static --repos omniclaude,omniintelligence    # Scope to specific repos
/hostile-reviewer --static --categories dead-code,stubs-shipped   # Scope to specific categories
/hostile-reviewer --static --max-tickets 5                        # Lower ticket cap
```

**Finding Categories:**

1. **dead-code** — Module-level unused functions/classes (LLM) + cross-file dead code (vulture, >=80% confidence)
2. **missing-error-handling** — Bare `except:` / `except Exception:` with `pass`
3. **stubs-shipped** — `TODO`/`FIXME`/`NotImplementedError` in non-test source
4. **missing-kafka-wiring** — Topics declared in contract.yaml but not wired in code
5. **schema-mismatches** — Pydantic field mismatches against contract config_keys
6. **hardcoded-values** — IP addresses, port numbers, connection strings in source
7. **missing-tests** — Source modules with no corresponding test file

**State tracking**: `.onex_state/code-review-state.json` tracks file hashes and finding fingerprints to avoid re-scanning unchanged files and dedup findings across runs.

**First-run safety**: The first invocation defaults to `--dry-run` unless explicitly overridden.

**Hard cap**: 10 tickets per run (configurable via `--max-tickets`).

**ModelCodeReviewFinding schema:**
```python
{
  "repo":        str,      # e.g. "omniclaude"
  "path":        str,      # repo-relative path
  "line":        int,      # 0 if whole-file
  "category":    str,      # e.g. "dead-code"
  "message":     str,      # human-readable description
  "severity":    str,      # CRITICAL | ERROR | WARNING | INFO
  "confidence":  str,      # HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW
  "fingerprint": str,      # dedup key: "{repo}:{path}:{line}:{category}"
  "is_new":      bool,     # not seen in prior run
  "ticketed":    bool,     # ticket was created
}
```

## Execution

### Convergence Loop (default behavior)

The skill iterates until convergence. **Convergence** = 2 consecutive passes where no
finding is above NIT severity. This is the default behavior.

Override with `--passes N` for a fixed number of passes (e.g., `--passes 1` for
single-pass backwards compatibility).

**Algorithm:**

```
consecutive_clean = 0
pass_number = 0
max_passes = args.passes or 10  # safety cap to prevent infinite loops
iteration_history = []

while consecutive_clean < 2 and pass_number < max_passes:
    pass_number += 1
    start_time = now()

    # 1. Run multi-model review
    result = run_review(mode, target, models)

    # 2. Count findings above NIT
    above_nit = [f for f in result.findings if f.severity in (CRITICAL, MAJOR, MINOR)]

    # 3. Record pass in iteration history
    iteration_history.append({
        "pass": pass_number,
        "duration_s": elapsed(start_time),
        "verdict": result.verdict,
        "counts": {
            "CRITICAL": count(CRITICAL),
            "MAJOR": count(MAJOR),
            "MINOR": count(MINOR),
            "NIT": count(NIT)
        },
        "models_used": result.models_succeeded,
        "action": "clean" if not above_nit else "fix_and_rerun"
    })

    # 4. Check convergence
    if not above_nit and result.verdict != "degraded":
        consecutive_clean += 1
    else:
        consecutive_clean = 0

    # 5. If not converged, apply fixes and loop
    if consecutive_clean < 2 and above_nit:
        apply_fixes(above_nit)  # dispatch to polymorphic-agent for code changes

    # If --passes N was specified and we hit it, stop regardless
    if args.passes and pass_number >= args.passes:
        break
```

**Safety cap**: The loop runs at most 10 passes (configurable via `--passes`). If
convergence is not reached in 10 passes, the skill reports partial convergence with
the full iteration history.

### Single Pass Steps

Each pass within the loop executes:

1. Determine mode (PR or file) from arguments.
2. Invoke the multi-model review CLI:

**PR mode (default models):**
```bash
uv run python -m omniintelligence.review_pairing.cli_review \  # local-path-ok: omniintelligence direct CLI invocation until OMN-8770 onex run migration
  --pr <N> --repo <owner/repo> --model codex --model deepseek-r1 2>/dev/null
```

**File mode (default models):**
```bash
uv run python -m omniintelligence.review_pairing.cli_review \  # local-path-ok: omniintelligence direct CLI invocation until OMN-8770 onex run migration
  --file <path> --model codex --model deepseek-r1 2>/dev/null
```

When `--models` is provided, expand into repeated `--model` args dynamically:
```bash
# Example: --models deepseek-r1,qwen3-14b,codex
uv run python -m omniintelligence.review_pairing.cli_review \  # local-path-ok: omniintelligence direct CLI invocation until OMN-8770 onex run migration
  --pr <N> --repo <owner/repo> --model deepseek-r1 --model qwen3-14b --model codex 2>/dev/null
```

3. Parse the `ModelMultiReviewResult` JSON from stdout.
4. If `--ticket_id` is provided, load TCB constraints from
   `$ONEX_STATE_DIR/tcb/{ticket_id}/bundle.json` and cross-reference findings
   against TCB invariants.

### Fix Application (between passes)

When a pass produces findings above NIT:

1. Report findings to the caller.
2. Dispatch a polymorphic-agent to apply fixes for all CRITICAL, MAJOR, and MINOR findings.
3. Stage the fixes (but do not commit -- the caller controls commits).
4. Re-run the review on the updated code.

### Post-Convergence

After convergence (or max passes reached):

1. Post the final findings summary as a GitHub PR review comment (PR mode only).
2. Persist results including full iteration history.
3. Emit completion event.

## Default Persona

All reviews (file-mode and PR-mode) use the **analytical-strict** persona by default.

This persona enforces:
- PhD-level domain expertise posture
- Journal-critique format (no praise, no qualifiers)
- Contract-semantics focus: invariant gaps, integration boundary failures, missing idempotency guards
- Specific "what to change and why" per finding (three sentences max)
- Skeptical analytical tone: nothing is assumed correct unless proven

Persona file: `omniintelligence/review_pairing/personas/analytical-strict.md`

To override: pass `--persona <name>` where `<name>` matches a file in
`omniintelligence/review_pairing/personas/`. To use no persona: pass
`--system-prompt /dev/null` (bypasses persona loading).

## Model Selection

Default models: `codex,deepseek-r1`

Codex CLI is the primary reviewer (ChatGPT-class model, highest signal-to-noise ratio).
DeepSeek-R1 provides a local reasoning cross-check without network dependency.

Override with `--models`:
```bash
/hostile-reviewer --pr 433 --repo OmniNode-ai/omniintelligence --models codex,qwen3-coder,deepseek-r1
```

Available models (see omniintelligence `review_pairing/models.py` for registry):
- `codex` -- Codex CLI (ChatGPT-class model, requires `codex` binary in PATH)
- `deepseek-r1` -- DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B (M2 Ultra, reasoning/code review)
- `qwen3-coder` -- Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B AWQ-4bit (RTX 5090, long context code)
- `qwen3-14b` -- Qwen3-14B-AWQ (RTX 4090, mid-tier)

## Output Format

### Per-Model Status

For each model, report:
- Model name
- Status (succeeded / failed with error)
- Finding count by severity

### Disagreement Rendering

When models materially disagree on a major issue (one flags CRITICAL/MAJOR,
the other is silent or disagrees), surface that disagreement explicitly
BEFORE the detailed grouped findings:

```
DISAGREEMENT: DeepSeek-R1 flags "Missing retry logic" as CRITICAL.
Codex did not flag this issue. Review the evidence below.
```

### Grouped Findings

Present findings grouped by source model:

```
## DeepSeek-R1 (4 findings)

1. [CRITICAL] Missing retry logic
   Category: architecture
   Evidence: ...
   Proposed fix: ...

## Codex (6 findings)
...
```

### Iteration History Table

The final output MUST include an iteration history table summarizing all passes:

```
## Iteration History

| Pass | Duration | Verdict        | CRIT | MAJ | MIN | NIT | Models       | Action        |
|------|----------|----------------|------|-----|-----|-----|--------------|---------------|
| 1    | 45.2s    | blocking_issue | 1    | 3   | 2   | 4   | codex, dr1   | fix_and_rerun |
| 2    | 38.7s    | risks_noted    | 0    | 1   | 1   | 2   | codex, dr1   | fix_and_rerun |
| 3    | 32.1s    | clean          | 0    | 0   | 0   | 1   | codex, dr1   | clean (1/2)   |
| 4    | 30.5s    | risks_noted    | 0    | 1   | 0   | 0   | codex, dr1   | fix_and_rerun |
| 5    | 29.8s    | clean          | 0    | 0   | 0   | 0   | codex, dr1   | clean (2/2)   |

Convergence: ACHIEVED after 5 passes (2 consecutive clean)
Total duration: 176.3s
Total findings resolved: 27
```

This table is the primary human-readable output of the iterative review. It is always
rendered even when `--passes 1` is used (showing a single row).

### Degraded-Mode Visibility

- If one model succeeds and one fails, report partial success explicitly.
- If ALL models fail, report failure and return gracefully. Do not block
  the calling workflow.
- Never silently omit a failed model from the output.

## Severity Mapping

Findings use canonical severity levels:
- **CRITICAL** (ERROR): Security, data loss, architectural redesign required
- **MAJOR** (WARNING): Performance, missing error handling, incomplete tests
- **MINOR** (INFO): Code quality, documentation gaps, edge cases
- **NIT** (HINT): Formatting, naming, minor refactoring

## Convergence Criteria

Default: **2 consecutive clean passes** (no findings above NIT severity).

A "clean pass" means:
- At least one model succeeded (not degraded)
- No CRITICAL, MAJOR, or MINOR findings across all models
- NIT findings are allowed and do not reset the consecutive counter

The 2-consecutive requirement prevents false convergence from a single lucky pass.
Evidence from the ModelPlanContract review (5 passes, 27 total findings) shows that
pass N fixes routinely introduce 2-4 new issues caught in pass N+1.

Override: `--passes N` sets a fixed pass count. The skill runs exactly N passes and
reports the final state regardless of convergence. Use `--passes 1` for single-pass
backwards compatibility.

## Verdict Determination

Per-pass verdict (unchanged from v2):
- `clean`: no findings above MINOR severity across all models (findings array may be empty or contain only NIT/MINOR entries). Requires at least one model to have succeeded.
- `risks_noted`: MAJOR findings exist but are not blocking -- implementer should address
- `blocking_issue`: at least one CRITICAL finding from any model -- must fix before merge
- `degraded`: ALL requested models failed. No findings were produced. This is NOT `clean` -- it means review could not be performed. The calling workflow decides whether to proceed or block.

Overall convergence verdict (new in v3):
- `converged`: 2 consecutive clean passes achieved. The code is stable.
- `partially_converged`: max passes reached with fewer than 2 consecutive clean passes. Findings may still exist.
- `not_converged`: fixed-pass mode (`--passes N`) completed without achieving convergence. Informational only.

## When Called

- **ticket-pipeline Phase 2.4** (between local_review and mergeability_gate) -- PR mode
- **ticket-pipeline Phase 5.5 (review_gate)** -- `--gate` mode (replaces former review_gate skill)
- **design-to-plan Phase 2c** (after R1-R7 convergence) -- file mode
- **Standalone** for any PR or plan file

## Token Budget

**`2>/dev/null` is MANDATORY in all `prompt.md` bash blocks that invoke the aggregator.**

Each model (Gemini, Codex, Qwen3-Coder, DeepSeek-R1) emits hundreds to thousands of
tokens of chain-of-thought, progress output, and prose to stderr before producing its
JSON finding. Without `2>/dev/null`, every model's verbose output enters Claude's context
window on every review run, making multi-model review unviably expensive (~5,000–15,000
tokens per invocation instead of ~500).

The stdout-only JSON contract is what makes multi-model review viable:
- **stdout**: compact aggregated JSON (~500 tokens) — Claude Code sees this
- **stderr**: all model verbose output — silenced by `2>/dev/null`, never enters context
- **event bus**: full per-model raw findings — captured here for observability via
  `hostile.reviewer.completed` / `hostile.reviewer.failed` events (OMN-6188)

**Do not remove `2>/dev/null` from prompt.md.** If you need to debug model output,
redirect stderr to a temp file instead: `2>/tmp/hostile-reviewer-debug.log`.
